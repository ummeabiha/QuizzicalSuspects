# Quizzical Suspects

## Project Objective

Have you ever encountered a concept that only became clear when you tried to implement it? Fear not, for we present the solution with "Quizzical Suspects," a demo quiz application inspired by NEDUETI's entrance test. This application features proper sign-up and login functionalities, displaying previous attempt results upon login. Users can choose from different subjects, each with three difficulty levels: Easy, Medium, and Hard. Questions are randomly selected from the database, and users can attempt the quiz multiple times.

## Features

- **Signup Feature:** Allows new users to create an account with username verification from the database.
  
- **Login:** Existing users can log in, with verification from the database and error messages for incorrect entries.
  
- **Record Page:** Displays the records of users' previous attempts.

- **Subject and Difficulty Selection:** Users can choose subjects (PL, FIT) and difficulty levels (Easy, Medium, Hard).

- **Question Display:** Displays questions fetched from the database based on user choices, with a limit of 5 random questions.

- **Result Display:** Shows the result at the end of the quiz and inserts the result into the database.

- **Try Again Option:** Allows users to play the quiz again.
